    1. Create a function called addNum which will be able to add two numbers.
        - Numbers must be provided as arguments.
        - Return the result of the addition.
       
    2. Create a function called subNum which will be able to subtract two numbers.
        - Numbers must be provided as arguments.
        - Return the result of subtraction.

    3. Create a function called multiplyNum which will be able to multiply two numbers.
        - Numbers must be provided as arguments.
        - Return the result of the multiplication.

    4. Create a function divideNum which will be able to divide two numbers.
        - Numbers must be provided as arguments.
        - Return the result of the division.

    5. Create a function called getCircleArea which will be able to get total area of a circle from a provided radius.
        - a number should be provided as an argument.
        - look up the formula for calculating the area of a circle with a provided/given radius.
        - look up the use of the exponent operator.
        - return the result of the area calculation.

    6. Create a function called getAverage which will be able to get total average of four numbers.
        - 4 numbers should be provided as an argument.
        - look up the formula for calculating the average of numbers.
        - return the result of the average calculation.
    
    7. Create a function called checkIfPassed which will be able to check if you passed by checking the percentage of your score against the passing percentage.
        - this function should take 2 numbers as an argument, your score and the total score.
        - First, get the percentage of your score against the total. You can look up the formula to get percentage.
        - Using a relational operator, check if your score percentage is greater than 75, the passing percentage. Save the value of the comparison in a variable called isPassed.
        - return the value of the variable isPassed.
        - This function should return a boolean.
